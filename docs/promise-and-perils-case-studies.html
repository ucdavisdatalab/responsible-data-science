<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Automation<a href="promise-and-perils-case-studies.html#automation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>While automation comes in many forms, perhaps the most salient examples come
from changes within the workforce. For example, advances in technology created
in part through data science have reduced the danger presented to human workers
through replacement or supplementation.</p>
<div id="case-1-robotics-in-factories-and-mining" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Case 1: Robotics in Factories and Mining<a href="promise-and-perils-case-studies.html#case-1-robotics-in-factories-and-mining" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Historically, factory and mining jobs have been the most dangerous
and unrewarding jobs with relatively low wages and, in many cases, the constant
threat of disaster and workplace injury. Robots and other automation
technologies were introduced not only to increase productivity, but also to
reduce the negative consequences to humans who previously worked those jobs.
Here we don’t describe any one employment sector, instead we give an overview
of the potential impacts of automation in various workplaces.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: The rate of workplace death and injury in factory and mining jobs
have steadily decreased since robots were first introduced into the
manufacturing process in 1980. Additionally, with the design of more ergonomic
robots there is the benefit of reducing musculoskeletal disorders, to which
factory workers are particularly susceptible.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences</strong>: Transitioning to robotic labor has had a major socioeconomic
impact in the United States. There has been an estimated 50-70% decrease in
manufacturing jobs due to automation since 1980. While the incorporation of
automation opened new jobs in robot maintenance and manufacturing, many
individuals previously employed in factory jobs did not have the skills to fill
these new more high-tech jobs, leading to massive unemployment rates,
disproportionately affecting older workers. In addition, by shifting the power
between management and labor positions, automating the workforce has weakened
the power of organized labor, which has been the driving force of labor laws
across all employment sectors.</p>

<div id="case-2-automation-in-public-safety" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Case 2: Automation in Public Safety<a href="promise-and-perils-case-studies.html#case-2-automation-in-public-safety" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: In the early 2010s many public safety operations began benefiting
from the use of artificial intelligence (AI) robotics and machine learning
algorithms. Here we review the impacts of automated labor and decision-making
related to “public safety,” broadly defined as emergency responders (i.e.,
police, military, search and rescue, etc.). Below we discuss the various
impacts of the decisions from positive (injury and loss of life prevention) to
negative (mental health and human rights impacts).</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: For example, bomb and hazardous material disposal robots began taking
the place of safety technicians/specialists, thereby preserving human life.
Militarized automated technology, such as flight drones equipped with risk
assessment AI, has reduced the number of human pilots in combat zones. More
recently, AI robots have been proposed as a supplement or replacement for first
responders, such as rescue teams, during natural disasters.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences</strong>: Some of these robots utilize facial recognition, surveillance
AI, and/or are armed with weapons. Decision-making using AI (especially facial
recognition) has repeatedly shown racial and ethnic biases. There are major
concerns from various human rights organizations, academic institutions and
advocacy groups about liability for public safety robot malfunctions,
inaccurate or biased decision making by automated software, and privacy
concerns about public surveillance and facial recognition. In November of 2022,
San Francisco officials voted yes to allow armed robots to be used in “extreme”
circumstances. Less than a week later SF regulatory board overturned the
decision after public outcry about Killer robots. There is insufficient
support for the mental health needs of flight drones’ human pilots, who
increasingly suffer from PTSD. Even the more “benign” automated traffic tickets
through speedometer and license plate camera disproportionately affect
communities of color. In D.C. it was found that black neighborhoods were fined
17 times more often in lower-income black communities compared to
white-segregated neighborhoods. Evidence suggests that this disparity is not
due to base rate differences in traffic violations. Instead, communities of
color had more automated surveiled locations than wealthy parts of the city. In
addition, vendors of these technologies have been found to regulate yellow
light durations and increase the administrative costs to the city which
inflates fine amounts disproportionately directed at marginalized communities.
This is only one of the many examples of automation targeting marginalized
communities.</p>

<div id="case-3-self-driving-cars" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> Case 3: Self-Driving Cars<a href="promise-and-perils-case-studies.html#case-3-self-driving-cars" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Just think of the amount of free-time we would have if our cars
could drive themselves! Beyond being a very cool and attractive advancement in
technology. The implications of automatic vehicles has become a greatly
contentious issue due to potential impacts on losses of life, jobs, liability,
and marginalized communities.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: Since 1986 (when the car seat law took effect in all 50 states in the
US) through 2021, there have been approximately 40,000 traffic fatalities per
year (<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/data" class="uri">https://www.nhtsa.gov/data</a>). In theory, self-driven cars should be safer
than ones driven by humans. Computer processing speeds are millions of times
faster than the average human reaction time, so unexpected collisions could be
rare in a future of entirely self-driving cars.</p>
<p><strong>Predicted Consequences</strong>: Over 2.2 million people are currently employed as
drivers in the US. If we switched to fully automated drivers, would there still
be a need for these employees? The Canadian government estimates over 1 million
jobs in Canada will be lost from self-driving cars. Automation in driving poses
the same short-term harm, but long term benefits that automation in the
industrial jobs posed in the 1990s and early 2000s. Much of the official
discourse focuses on the economic impact of a shift toward automatic vehicles.
However, a more important consequence is that self-driving cars rely on the
same computer vision technologies that we have already seen to be racially
biased – these cars are more likely to kill black pedestrians than white
pedestrians (Wilson et al, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Dilemma</strong>: Self-driving cars may be the way of the future, but all
technological advances take trial and error before being perfected. What would
that period of trial and error look like for self-driving cars? Given existing
known biases in AI and computer vision technologies, we can expect that
marginalized populations will be the most negatively impacted. If the
probability of malfunctioning is less than the probability of a crash due to
human error, is that good enough to go to market? Who is liable if the AI
manages to learn unsafe driving practices from its surroundings? What does
liability look like for insurance companies, car manufacturers, car owners? How
will this disadvantage individuals who are unable to afford self-driving cars?
What is the carbon footprint for something so computationally intensive? These
are just a few of the ethics and equity concerns with automated vehicle
development that our society has yet to address.</p>

<div id="accessibility" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Accessibility<a href="promise-and-perils-case-studies.html#accessibility" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Accessibility is a fundamental requirement for equity. Accessibility does not
just relate to disability accommodations, although that is incredibly
important. It also involves equitable access to resources, information, and
opportunities. In addition, accessibility needs are different for different
people and in different contexts. While as a society we still have a long way
to go in supporting equitable access to various needs for various people, data
science has contributed to greater accessibility for a large population of
people who have previously had limited access to many quality of life
improvements.</p>
<div id="case-4-health-tracking-and-precision-medicine" class="section level4 hasAnchor">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.0.1</span> Case 4: Health Tracking and Precision Medicine<a href="promise-and-perils-case-studies.html#case-4-health-tracking-and-precision-medicine" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The intersection of biostatistics, data-science, software
development and biotechnology has led to an increase in mobile applications
(apps) aimed at tracking health metrics and outcomes. These advances have led
to a major cultural shift regarding awareness around personal health. Consumer
research suggests that over 60% of smartphone users use one or more mobile
health (mHealth) apps. There is even evidence that health care workers
“prescribe” or recommend specific mHealth apps. In addition most mHealth apps
include features that are free to use. However, as these apps are generally not
subject to regulation, misuse can lead to negative physical and mental health
outcomes, especially in vulnerable populations.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: On the academic side, the accessibility of vast amounts of
non-invasive health data has allowed researchers to develop innovative methods
and products. From a public health perspective, many individuals also have a
better understanding of general and their personal health trends. Gamification
on these apps promotes healthy behaviors like drinking water, exercising, sleep
hygiene, mental health interventions (such as mindfulness and coping skills),
etc. In addition, health tracking apps can help monitor symptoms and triggers
for those with chronic disorders/illnesses like diabetes, Crohn’s disease, mood
disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). According to the CDC, 9.7% of
people who reside in the US were uninsured in 2020. While health apps are not a
replacement for actual healthcare, they have the potential to provide valuable
services that make substantial differences in health outcomes in underserved
populations.</p>
<p><strong>Unintended Consequences</strong>: Despite the increased usage of smart devices in
low socio-economic populations and the advocacy around their potential for
combating health inequities, evidence suggests that the full potential of
mHealth apps is still only accessible to a small percentage of people
underserved by health care systems. In addition, while mHealth apps may be
accurate “on average,” they may not be appropriate for a given user’s
physiology and over-reliance on mass-produced health apps thus poses safety
concerns. Weight-loss apps, especially, have a huge potential for misuse and
some apps marketed to help with weight loss have been associated with higher
rates of disordered eating. Truly individualized, precision medicine focused
mHealth apps are likely to continue to be costly, rare, and widely inaccessible
to underserved populations.</p>
<p><strong>Dilemma</strong>: Most health apps used in the US are not regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA); despite what the apps claim there is no guarantee
that their information is accurate. Additionally, any information shared over
health apps is not guaranteed to be under HIPAA protection. For example, your
identifiable health data can be sold to insurance companies, who can use that
information to impact your insurance prices and premiums. Employers could use
the data for hiring and career decisions. Health data in these apps is more
vulnerable to theft by hackers, and has an increased risk for surveillance.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Historically, people with sensory impairments have had limited
accessibility to the majority of internet and smart device functionality. Only
within the last 5 years has text-to-speech, auto-captioning, and AI-generated
photo descriptions become mainstream for online content, with tremendous
accessibility increases for those with visual and auditory impairments.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: Data science has also been used to develop “smart” assistive
technologies that allow for sound mixing hearing aids, prosthetic limb control,
computer vision (medicine recognition, color recognition, physical writing to
speech, assistive sign language), and smart cane navigation, to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Unintended Impact</strong>: The availability and accessibility of the assistive
technologies themselves is often limited. Medical devices in this space are
often expensive and/or not deemed medically necessary (and therefore not
covered by most health insurance companies), which further disproportionately
disadvantages underserved populations. The resulting loss of economic and
social opportunities due to barriers in accessing accessible technologies
further reinforces existing inequities.</p>
<p><strong>Dilemma</strong>: There is a severe lack of research regarding the impact or
availability of assistive technologies to their relevant communities within the
US. Many devices are developed by private corporations and strong copyright
laws prevent these technologies from being made available in other countries or
locations. Even federally-funded projects typically generate products that are
economically non-viable for a majority of the population they aim to support.</p>

<p>These case studies illustrate the multifaceted contributions of data science to
modern living. The fact that there are unintended consequences and ethical
dilemmas associated with data science advancements seeking to promote social
good does not negate its role, but instead serves as a note of caution. As data
scientists it is our job to predict and reduce the impact of negative
consequences that may emerge from our research and development products. The
fact that we still have a long way to go should inspire you to continue to
innovate the data science tools, methods, and approaches in your domain.</p>
